# Device Guard

**Device Guard** is a fun, military-inspired web project that offers "elite" (and totally fictional) protection plans for your electronic devices. This site is a parody and not a real serviceâ€”enjoy the absurd terms, privacy policy, and playful design!

## Features

- Military-themed UI with custom camouflage and shield branding
- Absurd and humorous Terms of Service and Privacy Policy
- Device protection "plans" for mobiles, laptops, PCs, consoles, and businesses
- Animated, responsive design using custom CSS
- Fake signup form (no data is actually collected)
- Links to [Eizan's Portfolio](https://eizan-matarin.github.io/Portfolio-Eizan/)

## Pages

- **Home:** Main landing page with plans and signup form
- **About:** Info about Device Guard and its "mission"
- **Privacy Policy:** Ridiculous privacy rules (mostly about coffee)
- **Terms of Service:** Completely absurd legal terms
- **More:** Link to the creator's portfolio

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Explore the site, read the silly policies, and try out the fake signup form!

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 (custom, no frameworks)
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for typography
- No JavaScript frameworks (vanilla JS only if needed)

## Disclaimer

> **Device Guard is not a real company.**  
> No devices are actually protected.  
> All policies and terms are jokes.  
> Enjoy and have fun!
